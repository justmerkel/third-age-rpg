Every character capable of casting spells or miracles has a \textbf{Magic} or \textbf{Divinity} stat. This stat acts as maximum amount of wild magic energy a character can withstand before being unable to cast. That energy is expressed as a temperature gauge (known as \textbf{Wild Magic Gauge}) on a character's sheet with a number of segments equal to the stat. If a spell would exceed this gauge on a failure, the spell cannot be cast.
\begin{mercHeading}
{Adding to Wild Magic Gauge}
\end{mercHeading}
When a character casts a spell from a given class, they must make an attribute roll of the class's casting attribute. On a failure, the spell fizzles and has either no or reduced effect, and the spell's level is added to the wild magic gauge. On a partial success, the spell executes as normal, but the spell's level is added to the wild magic gauge. On a success, the spell executes as normal. Cantrips are a special type of spell that do not add to the gauge on a partial success.\vspace{2pt}\\
  \textbf{Full Wild Magic Gauge:}
Once the wild magic gauge is filled, the spell has an additional wild magic effect. This is determined by rolling on the Wild Magic table on pg \pageref{table:WildMagic} or an effect the referee thinks is thematic.
\begin{mercHeading}
Concentration
\end{mercHeading}

Spells that specify concentration or require multiple rounds to cast, uses the caster's action every round until the spell ends or is cast. When a caster is hit while concentrating, they must make a \textbf{Body} attribute roll to maintain the spell. On a failure, the spell fizzles and ends. On a partial success, the caster can choose to roll on the wild magic table or end the spell. On a success, nothing happens.
