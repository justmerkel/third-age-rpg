\begin{mercHeading}
Attribute Roll
\end{mercHeading}

An \textbf{Attribute Roll} is 2d6 + attribute. On a result of 6 or less, the roll is a failure. On a result of 7-9, the roll is a partial success. On a result of 10+ the roll is considered a success.\\
\textbf{Modifying Attribute Rolls} A referee may decide any attribute roll to be easier (add up to +3 to a result) or more difficult (subtract up to 3). \\
\textbf{Advantage/Disadvantage} Another way to modify rolls is to use advantage best 2 out of 3 d6 or disadvantage worst 2 out of 3 d6.\\
\textbf{Saving Throw} A saving throw is a special type of attribute roll to avoid effects.
\subsection*{Other Stats}
There are other stats on the character sheet that are dependent on the class.



\begin{mercHeading}
Health and Hit Die
\end{mercHeading}
Health (\textbf{HP}) is the number of points of damage a character can take before death. This stat is generated by the \textbf{Hit Dice} of the class by rolling (At first level take the Maximum). For monsters, this is always a d8 and the number of hit dice affects how some stats and saves work.

\begin{mercHeading}
Attack Bonus
\end{mercHeading}
The Attack Bonus is added to the attack roll as described on pg \pageref{label:atkroll}.

\begin{mercHeading}
Stamina
\end{mercHeading}
Stamina allows for off turn actions in combat, and performing various feats.

\begin{mercHeading}
Magic/Divine
\end{mercHeading}
This is the stat that governs spells or miracles respectively. This is explained in more detail on the class pages and general magic rules on pg \pageref{section:GenMagicRules}.

\begin{mercHeading}
Armor Class
\end{mercHeading}
Armor Class (\textbf{AC}) is the measure of a character's ability to take blows. In The Third Age Armor is split into a partial success (for glancing blows), and full success. Partial AC is calculated by 9 + dexterity and Success AC is 13 + dexterity. Armor and shields modify this value \pageref{table:Armor}.

\begin{mercHeading}
Experience
\end{mercHeading}
Experience (\textbf{XP}) is the measure of the amount of cumulative \emph{experience} a character has had adventuring. This number increases by 1 for each gold piece recovered and a certain amount per monster determined by the referee.
